This tutorial describes how to:

* Start a Redpanda cluster to store and stream chat room messages.
* Write a client application in {language} to produce and consume chat room messages.
* Build and run multiple clients to exchange chat messages streamed through Redpanda.

== Prerequisites

ifdef::lang-go[]
Download and install Go from https://go.dev/doc/install[go.dev].
endif::[]

ifdef::env-cloud[]
Redpanda Cloud environments use certificates signed by https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt]. Most programming languages load their root certificate authority (CA), `ISRG Root X1`, by default so you shouldn't need to provide a custom CA.
endif::[]

== Set up Redpanda

ifdef::env-cloud[]
Complete the xref:get-started:quick-start-cloud.adoc[{quickstart-title}] before continuing. This tutorial expands on the quickstart.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-docker[]
Complete the xref:get-started:quick-start.adoc[{quickstart-title}] before continuing. This tutorial expands on the quickstart. You can choose to run either one or three brokers.

CAUTION: If you're running Redpanda in a shared development environment, avoid running
`sudo rpk redpanda tune all` or manually configuring Redpanda for production. The optimized production settings might affect your experience with other applications running on your machine.
endif::[]

== Set up your environment

ifdef::lang-go[]
. Create and set your working directory to the project folder, `chat-room`:
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir chat-room
cd chat-room
----

. Initialize the project:
+
[,bash]
----
go mod init com/redpanda/chat-room
----

. Install the required dependencies:
+
[,bash]
----
go get github.com/twmb/franz-go@v1.9.0
go get github.com/google/uuid@v1.3.0
go get github.com/twmb/tlscfg@v1.3.1
----
endif::[]

== Create a topic

You need a topic named `chat-room` for both Redpanda and the client to use to store chat room messages. If you completed the {quickstart-title}, this topic already exists in your cluster.

ifdef::env-cloud[]
. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic list --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
----

. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk] to create a `chat-room` topic:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
----
endif::[]

ifdef::env-docker[]
. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic list
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
----

. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk] to create a `chat-room` topic:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
----
endif::[]

== Confirm that the topic exists on the client side

The client may not always know that the topic exists. You can verify that it exists and create it if not.

In the `chat-room/` directory, create a source file called `admin.{file-suffix}` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the {quickstart-title}.

ifdef::env-cloud+lang-go[]
.`admin.go`
[,go]
----
include::develop:example$chat-room/go/cloud/admin.go[]
----
endif::[]

== Create a producer

A client needs a producer to publish `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a producer for the client, create a source file called `producer.{file-suffix}` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the {quickstart-title}.

ifdef::env-cloud+lang-go[]
.`producer.go`
[,go]
----
include::develop:example$chat-room/go/cloud/producer.go[]
----
endif::[]

You now have a working producer that sends strings entered by the user to the
`chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings here,
but keep in mind that the producer only sends buffers, so you can encode the
messages however you like.

== Create a consumer

A client needs a consumer to receive `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a consumer for the client, in `chat-room/` create a source file `consumer.{file-suffix}` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the {quickstart-title}.

ifdef::env-cloud+lang-go[]
.`consumer.go`
[,go]
----
include::develop:example$chat-room/go/cloud/consumer.go[]
----
endif::[]

You now have a consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as
you like, but remember that each group reads a message only once, which is
why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID. This way, each time you run the application, you see all previous messages.

== Create a client application

The client needs an application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

To create a client application, in `chat-room/` create a source file `main.{file-suffix}` with the following content.

Replace the placeholders with the same values that you used in the {quickstart-title}.

ifdef::env-cloud+lang-go[]
.`main.go`
[,go]
----
include::develop:example$chat-room/go/cloud/main.go[]
----
endif::[]

== Build and run the application

Build the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:
ifdef::lang-go[]
. Run the client application:
+
```
go run .
```
endif::[]
. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.
. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.
+
For example:
+
----
Enter user name:
Alice
Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
----

== Next steps

This is a basic example of a chat room application. You can improve this application by implementing additional features and components, such as:

* A user interface to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
* A user registration and login system to authenticate users before they can access the chat room.
* Rate limiting and other measures to prevent spamming and abuse in the chat room.
