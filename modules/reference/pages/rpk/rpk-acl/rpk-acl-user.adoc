= rpk acl user
:description: rpk acl user

Manage SASL users.

If SASL is enabled, a SASL user is what you use to talk to Redpanda, and ACLs
control what your user has access to. See `rpk acl --help` for more information
about ACLs, and `rpk acl user create --help` for more information about
creating SASL users. Using SASL requires setting `enable_sasl: true` in the
redpanda section of your `redpanda.yaml`.
