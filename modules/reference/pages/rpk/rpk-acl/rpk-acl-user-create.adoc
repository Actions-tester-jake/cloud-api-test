= rpk acl user create
:description: rpk acl user create

Create a SASL user.

This command creates a single SASL user with the given password, optionally
with a custom mechanism. SASL consists of three parts: a username, a
password, and a mechanism. The mechanism determines which authentication flow
the client will use for this user/pass.

Redpanda currently supports two mechanisms: SCRAM-SHA-256, the default, and
SCRAM-SHA-512, which is the same flow but uses sha512 rather than sha256.

Using SASL requires setting `enable_sasl: true` in the redpanda section of your
`redpanda.yaml`. Before a created SASL account can be used, you must also create
ACLs to grant the account access to certain resources in your cluster. See the
acl help text for more info.
