= rpk topic consume
:description: rpk topic consume

Consume records from topics.

Consuming records reads from any amount of input topics, formats each record
according to `--format`, and prints them to `STDOUT`. The output formatter
understands a wide variety of formats.

The default output format `--format json` is a special format that outputs each
record as JSON. There may be more single-word-no-escapes formats added later.
Outside of these special formats, formatting follows the rules described below.
