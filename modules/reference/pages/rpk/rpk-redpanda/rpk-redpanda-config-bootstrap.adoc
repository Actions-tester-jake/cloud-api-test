= rpk redpanda config bootstrap
:description: rpk redpanda config bootstrap

Initialize the configuration to bootstrap a cluster.

`--id` is mandatory. bootstrap will expect the machine it's running on
to have only one private non-loopback IP address associated to it,
and use it in the configuration as the node's address.

If it has multiple IPs, `--self` must be specified.
In that case, the given IP will be used without checking whether it's
among the machine's addresses or not.

The elements in `--ips` must be separated by a comma, no spaces.

If omitted, the node will be configured as a root node, that other
ones can join later.

== Usage

[,bash]
----
rpk redpanda config bootstrap --id <id> [--self &lt;ip&gt;] [--ips <ip1,ip2,...>] [flags]
