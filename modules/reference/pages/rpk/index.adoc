This page contains an alphabetized list of `rpk` commands. Each command includes a table of flags and their descriptions. You can also get descriptions for each flag by running `rpk <command> --help` in your locally-installed Redpanda, and you can get descriptions of all rpk-specific options by running xref:./rpk-x-options.adoc[`rpk -X help`]. The commands feature autocompletion. For more information, see xref:./rpk-generate/rpk-generate-shell-completion.adoc[`rpk generate shell-completion`].
