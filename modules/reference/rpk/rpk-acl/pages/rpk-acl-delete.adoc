= rpk acl delete
:description: rpk acl delete

Delete ACLs.

Delete flags work in a similar multiplying effect as creating ACLs, but delete is more advanced:
deletion works on a filter basis. Any unspecified flag defaults to matching
everything (all operations, or all allowed principals, etc). To ensure that you
do not accidentally delete more than you intend, this command prints everything
that matches your input filters and prompts for a confirmation before the
delete request is issued. Anything matching more than 10 ACLs doubly confirms.
