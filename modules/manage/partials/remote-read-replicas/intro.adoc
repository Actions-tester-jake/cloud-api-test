A Remote Read Replica topic is a read-only topic that mirrors a topic on a different cluster. Remote Read Replicas work with both xref:./tiered-storage:.adoc[Tiered Storage] and xref:./data-archiving.adoc[archival storage].

When a topic has cloud storage enabled, you can create a separate remote cluster just for consumers of this topic, and populate its topics from remote storage. A read-only topic on a remote cluster can serve any consumer, without increasing the load on the origin cluster. Use cases for Remote Read Replicas include data analytics, offline model training, and development clusters.
