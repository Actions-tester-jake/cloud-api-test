Spin up a Redpanda cluster with Redpanda Cloud, create a basic streaming application using the rpk command-line tool, and explore your cluster in Redpanda Console.

Redpanda Cloud is a fully managed Redpanda cluster hosted on dedicated resources and configurable instance types.

== Prerequisites

https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=cloud-trial[Sign up for a trial] of Redpanda Cloud - Dedicated Clusters.

== Deploy Redpanda

To deploy a Redpanda cluster in the Dedicated cloud, create a namespace, then follow the steps for creating a Dedicated cluster.

To create a namespace:+++<CreateNamespace>++++++</CreateNamespace>+++

To create a cluster:

. Click *Add Cluster*.
. Click *Create Dedicated cluster*, and enter the following values:
 ** *Cluster name*:
+
----
redpandaquickstart
----

 ** *Throughput*: 1 MBps
 ** *Version*: Choose the latest available version
. Click *Next* to see the *Cloud settings* options, and enter the following values:
 ** *Provider*: AWS
 ** *Region*: Any region that's closest to you
 ** *Availability*: Single AZ
 ** *Select a zone*: Choose any zone
. Click *Next* to see the *Networking* options, and enter the following values:
 ** *Connection Type*: Public Network
. Click *Create*.
. Wait for both your network and your cluster to be created.

== Start streaming

To start building a basic streaming application, you can use rpk to create a topic, produce messages to it, and consume messages from it.
rpk is a command-line tool for connecting to and interacting with Redpanda brokers.

. Install rpk on your local machine:

:::note
  The `rpk` binary is not supported on Windows.

. On the *Overview* page of Redpanda Cloud, copy your bootstrap server address and set it as an environment variable on your local machine:

[,bash]
----
  export RPK_BROKERS="<bootstrap-server-address>"
----

. In Redpanda Cloud, go to *Security* and create a user called *redpanda-chat-account* that uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism.
. Copy the password, and set the following environment variables on your local machine:

[,bash]
----
  export REDPANDA_SASL_USERNAME="redpanda-chat-account"
  export REDPANDA_SASL_PASSWORD="<password>"
  export REDPANDA_SASL_MECHANISM="SCRAM-SHA-256"
----

. In Redpanda Cloud, click the name of your user and add the following permissions to the ACL (access control list):
 ** *Host*: *
 ** *Topic name*:
+
----
chat-room
----

 ** *Operations*: All
. Use rpk on your local machine to authenticate to Redpanda as the redpanda-chat-account user and get information about the cluster:

[,bash]
----
  rpk cluster info --tls-enabled
----

. Create a topic called `chat-room`.

You granted permissions to the *redpanda-chat-account* user to access only this topic.

[,bash]
----
  rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
----

Output:

[,bash]
----
  TOPIC       STATUS
  chat-room  OK
----

. Produce a message to the topic:

[,bash]
----
  rpk topic produce chat-room --tls-enabled
----

. Enter a message, then press +++<kbd>+++Enter+++</kbd>+++:

[,text]
----
  Pandas are fabulous!
----

Example output:

[,text]
----
  Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
----

. Press +++<kbd>+++Ctrl+++</kbd>+++++++<kbd>+++C+++</kbd>+++ to finish producing messages to the topic.
. Consume one message from the topic:

[,bash]
----
  rpk topic consume chat-room --num 1 --tls-enabled
----

Your message is displayed along with its metadata,:

[,json]
----
  {
    "topic": "chat-room",
    "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
    "timestamp": 1663282629789,
    "partition": 0,
    "offset": 0
  }
----

== Explore your topic

In Redpanda Cloud, go to *Topics* > *chat-room*.

The message that you produced to the topic is displayed along with some other details about the topic.

== Clean up

If you don't want to continue experimenting with your cluster, you can delete it.

Go to *Cluster settings* and click *Delete cluster*.
