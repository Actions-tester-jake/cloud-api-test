== Technical preview features

Redpanda continuously adds new features and feature updates. Technical preview features are designed for user testing and feedback in development and testing environments. For example, xref:manage:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage] was a technical preview feature before it was promoted to general availability. Your feedback helps shape the future of Redpanda.
